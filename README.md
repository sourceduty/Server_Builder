### Server Hardware

Modern server hardware is diverse, designed to meet the varied demands of cloud computing, data centers, edge computing, and enterprise workloads. At the core, servers are powered by processors such as CPUs (Central Processing Units) and sometimes GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or specialized accelerators like TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) for AI workloads. Memory components like DDR4/DDR5 RAM are essential for rapid data access, while high-performance storage devices such as NVMe SSDs ensure fast data retrieval and write operations. For connectivity, servers rely on high-speed network interface cards (NICs), supporting up to 100GbE or more for data-intensive applications. Modular components like blade servers offer compact, high-density solutions, while rack-mounted servers remain standard for scalability in enterprise data centers.

Cooling systems play a critical role in maintaining server performance and longevity, with modern setups incorporating liquid cooling and airflow optimization for better thermal management. Additionally, power supplies have evolved to meet energy efficiency standards like 80 PLUS certifications, ensuring lower operational costs and environmental impact. The hardware ecosystem is further enriched by management tools like Baseboard Management Controllers (BMC) for remote monitoring and control. Together, these components form a robust infrastructure, enabling high performance, reliability, and scalability for workloads ranging from virtualization and AI to IoT and big data analytics.
